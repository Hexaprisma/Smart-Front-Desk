## Smart-Front-Desk
Are you looking for someone to take over your phone call services at a 24/7 tier? Well, good news: a smart front desk service AI, powered by OpenAI, is capable of handling most of the work. With a smart front desk, you can be free from all trivial phone call services and emphasize valuable services to your customers, raising your service quality to the next level of excellence.

This is an LLM-based phone customer service desk project. We provide an AI-powered front desk clerk who will be able to respond to customers by answering and scheduling appointments based on our shop database. This version is based on the OpenAI model; a much lighter-weighted AI will be developed later on.
